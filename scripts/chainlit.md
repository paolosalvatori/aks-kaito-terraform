# Kaito Chat ðŸ¤–

ðŸŽ‰ Ladies and gentlemen, introducing the flexible chat app that's as versatile as a contortionist! ðŸŒŸ This chat is built using [Chainlit](https://github.com/Chainlit/chainlit) and can be easily configured to directly utilize the [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/overview) or call the inference endpoint of a local model, such as [Falcon 7B Instruct](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct), which is installed and configured by [Kaito](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/ai-toolchain-operator) within the same [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes) cluster! âœ¨
